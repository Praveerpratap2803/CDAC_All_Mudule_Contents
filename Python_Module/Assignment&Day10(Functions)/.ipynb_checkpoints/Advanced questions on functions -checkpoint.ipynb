    "Q1 Write a function in Python to check duplicate letters inside a word, without considering case. It must accept a string, i.e., a sentence. The function should return True if the sentence has any word with duplicate letters, else return False. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "input: \n",
    "i am glad to be here!\n",
    "output True (because here word has duplicate letters)\n",
    "\n",
    "input:\n",
    "you are wonderful\n",
    "output False (because no word has duplicate letters)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2 Write a function in Python to parse a string such that it accepts a parameter- an encoded string. This encoded string will contain a first name, last name, and an id. You can separate the values in the string by any number of zeros. The id will not contain any zeros. The function should return a Python dictionary with the first name, last name, and id values. For example, if the input would be \"John000Doe000123\". Then the function should return: { \"first_name\": \"John\", \"last_name\": \"Doe\", \"id\": \"123\" }\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3 Write a function in Python to convert a decimal to a hex. It must accept a string of ASCII characters as input. The function should return the value of each character as a hexadecimal string. You have to remove the suffix 0x from all hex representations. You have to separate each byte by a space and return all alpha hexadecimal characters as lowercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex. input 'AB'\n",
    "Output '41 42'\n",
    "Explaination : hex value for 'A' is 0x41 and 'B' is 0x42. So take only 41 and 42 removing the prefix '0x' .\n",
    "\n",
    "input '@21Z'\n",
    "Output '40 32 31 5a'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4 Compress the given string S using following rules, \n",
    "- If the string contains a alphabate or special char, that occurs 4 times consecutively, then replace it with its compressed representation, (4, given character) in the string. \n",
    "- Neglect the case of latters when counting the repeatitions and creating compressed representation. \n",
    "- If there are multiple spaces then take them as a single space only, and replace with (1, ).\n",
    "- S is containing only aphabates or special characters, anything other than this should be kept as it is in the output\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex. \n",
    "input 'aabbbbeeeaa'\n",
    "output '(2,a)(4,b)(3,e)(2,a)'\n",
    "\n",
    "input 'Aa jj  '\n",
    "output '(2,a)(1, )(2,j)(1, )'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5 Write a function named 'format_number' that takes a number as its only parameter. Your function should convert the number to a string and add commas as a thousand separators. For example, calling format_number(1000000) should return \"1,000,000\". \n",
    "- In case negetive number then print error message\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6 There is pizza shop. When order is given it takes name of the person as input. There can be typo mistakes, so system allows to edit the name. Write a function which takes a name string as input, position, and new character. Then it changes character in name for given position with new character. Return the edited string from the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex. \n",
    "input \"SAW\",2,\"M\"\n",
    "output \"SAM\"\n",
    "\n",
    "input \"ABC\", 0, \"Z\"\n",
    "output \"ZBC\"\n",

    "Q8 There is an array of n integers. There are also 2 disjoint sets, A and B, each containing m integers. You like all the integers in set A and dislike all the integers in set B. Your initial happiness is 0. For each i integer in the array, if i belongs to A, you add 1 to your happiness. If i belongs to B, you add -1 to your happiness. Otherwise, your happiness does not change. Output your final happiness at the end.\n",
