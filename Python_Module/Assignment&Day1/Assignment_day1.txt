Q8. Python is platform independent or not ? Which platforms python can run ?
Ans Python is platform independent , can runs on windows, linux , mac.

Q9. Why python is platform independent ? What makes it platform independent ?
Ans Because python code is firstly compiled , which converts the code into byte code and that byte code can run on any m/c thats why python is platform independent. And that byte code is interpreted line by line by interpreter.

Q11. Find working of various functions (min 7) from math library of python which is provided as standard library. 
https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html
You can also try it yourself.
Ex. 
import math
print(math.factorial(4))
print(math.sin(90))
Ans import math

value1 = math.ceil(2.1)
print("",value1) 

value2 = math.comb(20, 9)#selecting 9 outof 20 items
print(value2)

value3 = math.perm(20,9)#selection and arrangement
print(value3)

value4 = math.floor(2.9)
print("floor value of ",2.9," is",value4)

value5 = math.remainder(10, 3)
print(value5)

value6 = math.pow(2, 3)
print(value6)

value7 = math.sqrt(64)
print(value7)

Q12. Open spyder IDE and create a python program (.py file) to print Hello world!. Run the program and check the put on console.
Ans output Hello world!
Q13.WAP using spyder IDE.  Import math library and print the gcd, lcm of two numbers.
Ans import math

value8 = math.gcd(18, 12)
print(value8)

value9 = math.lcm(18,12)
print(value9)
 
Q14. WAP using spyder IDE. Use math library. Print number of options you have, when you are given 5 different characters and you need to select 3 of them without repeatitions. (find permutations)
Ans import math

value10 = math.perm(5,3)
print(value10)

Q15. WAP using spyder IDE. Use math library. Print number of options you have to select 20 students out of 60 without repeatitions. ( Obviously here order doesn't matter, so find combinations) 
Ans import math
value11 = math.comb(60, 20)
print(value11)

Ans import math
v1 = 10
print(math.sqrt(v1))
